What is promise
=> It hold the result of async operation.
=> to overcome the problem  of callbackhell scenario promise is used.
=> It is an object, which holds the results of async operation.
-promise states
-promise chain
-promise.all()
-use of feth()& then()

callbackhell:-
function a1(){
function a2(){
}function a3(){}
console.log("Hi all") }


syntax:- let/const variablenama = new Promise((resolve,reject)=>{})

=> promise states:-
for every promise objects we have 3 states'
1.pending
2.fullfilled/resolved
3.rejected

.then and catch 
- to handle the promise object 

** promise in function:-
it will return the promiseif 
if there are both resolved and rejects state for the same funtion it executes the first state.
